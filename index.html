            Miracle messages started
            with a question. Why, in a nation with more homes than homeless  do
            so many people suffer needlessly against the elements, often dying
            in the cold, from sickness, or even starvation whilst the
            impassioned populace steps over them negating their struggle, and
            thus their humanity completely? While the bulk of this dehumanizing
            nature can be surmised as an overreaching effect of the nature of
            capitalism itself such a simple analysis simply would not do when
            the question of homelessness is not resolved, nor even properly
            addressed. We at Miracle Messages believe that every life is
            intrinsically valuable, and that every person has a place. Do we not
            all deserve a place to call home? We exist to help you find those
            that you have lost, but also to help those that are lost find their
            way to you. Help us on our Journey.

            volunteer you have to ability to add and browse cases at your
            discrection. You can also submit contact info so we can reach you if
